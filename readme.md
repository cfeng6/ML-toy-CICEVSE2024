# Machine Learning Toy Project on CICEVSE2024 Dataset 

Abnormal detection using classical machine learning algorithms on [CICEVSE2024](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/evse-dataset-2024.html).
## Dataset
The CICEVSE2024 dataset is designed to analyze the cybersecurity of EV charging stations. It contains:

- **Power consumption** data from the charging station.
- **Network traffic** data capturing communication between the station and external devices.
- **Event** data recorded from the charging station's hardware.

These data are collected under two types of scenarios: normal (benign) and under attack. The attack scenarios are divided into four categories:
1. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks – overwhelming the system to disrupt service.
2. Reconnaissance – scanning for vulnerabilities in the system.
3. Backdoor attacks – unauthorized remote access to the system.
4. Cryptojacking – hijacking system resources to mine cryptocurrency.
